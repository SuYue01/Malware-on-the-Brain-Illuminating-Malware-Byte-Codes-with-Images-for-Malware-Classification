# Malware-on-the-Brain-Illuminating-Malware-Byte-Codes-with-Images-for-Malware-Classification

This work explores the textures of malware to classify different families of malware, then further supply the convenience of anti-products to defend malware according to their classification. The statistical features of malware textures are extracted by one local algorithm that protects the difference of various malware families, and one global algorithm that acquires the certain information distribution used to uniquely recognize different malware families. Please cite the following paper if you borrow the ideas.
